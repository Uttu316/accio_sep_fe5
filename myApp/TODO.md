# TODO: Style Practice Page and Counter Component

## Steps:

- [x] Update Counter component to implement limit logic: Show "Limit Reached" if count > 10, "Not Allowed" if count < 0.
- [x] Add professional CSS styles to practice.css for the practice page (centering, clean background) and Counter component (card design with shadows, rounded corners, modern buttons and fonts).
- [ ] Verify the implementation by running the app and checking the styling and functionality.
